Suppose you have a `published_at` column of type `datetime`, but when filtering you want to compare only the date (without hour/minute/second).

## 1. Compare Date Only

Laravel Eloquent provides a built-in `whereDate()` method to compare only the date.

**Example:**

```php
// Get all data where published_at is on 2025-08-25
$posts = Post::whereDate('published_at', '2025-08-25')->get();
```

**With operator:**

```php
// published_at >= 2025-08-01
$posts = Post::whereDate('published_at', '>=', '2025-08-01')->get();
```

## 2. Compare with Another Column

If you want to compare with another column (e.g. `expired_at`):

```php
$posts = Post::whereRaw('DATE(published_at) = DATE(expired_at)')->get();
```

## 3. Using Query Builder

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$posts = Post::where(DB::raw('DATE(published_at)'), '2025-08-25')->get();
```

> ⚡ For most common cases, just use `whereDate()` because it's a built-in Eloquent helper to compare the date part of a datetime column.

## 4. Compare Full Datetime (Date + Time)

If you want to compare the full datetime (date and hour/minute/second), don't use `whereDate()`, but use the datetime column directly.

**Example:**

```php
// Exact match (date + time)
$posts = Post::where('published_at', '2025-08-25 14:30:00')->get();

// With operator
$posts = Post::where('published_at', '>=', '2025-08-25 00:00:00')
             ->where('published_at', '<=', '2025-08-25 23:59:59')
             ->get();
```

## 5. Compare Time Only

Use `whereTime()`:

```php
// Get all records with time greater than 14:00
$posts = Post::whereTime('published_at', '>', '14:00:00')->get();
```

## 6. Combine Date & Time

```php
$posts = Post::whereDate('published_at', '2025-08-25')
             ->whereTime('published_at', '>=', '08:00:00')
             ->whereTime('published_at', '<=', '17:00:00')
             ->get();
```

---

## Summary

- **whereDate()** → date only (ignore time).
- **whereTime()** → time only (ignore date).
- **Regular where()** → full datetime (date + time).

---

## 7. whereBetween & whereIn for Date Only

By default, `whereBetween` and `whereIn` work directly on the datetime value (including time). If you want date only, wrap the datetime column with `DATE()`.

**whereBetween for date only:**

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$posts = Post::whereBetween(
    DB::raw('DATE(published_at)'),
    ['2025-08-01', '2025-08-25']
)->get();
```

**whereIn for date only:**

```php
$dates = ['2025-08-01', '2025-08-05', '2025-08-10'];

$posts = Post::whereIn(DB::raw('DATE(published_at)'), $dates)->get();
```

**Alternative (more “eloquent way”):**

Usually for time ranges, use `whereBetween` directly on the datetime column but set the time boundaries manually:

```php
$posts = Post::whereBetween('published_at', [
    '2025-08-01 00:00:00',
    '2025-08-25 23:59:59',
])->get();
```

---

### Difference

- `DB::raw('DATE(...)')` → truly ignores the time, so all `2025-08-01 xx:yy:zz` are considered the same.
- `whereBetween('published_at', [...])` → still includes the time, but you can set the time `00:00:00 – 23:59:59` to cover the full day.
