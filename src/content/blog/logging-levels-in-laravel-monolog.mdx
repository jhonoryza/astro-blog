| Level        | Constant              | Number | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **debug**    | `Logger::DEBUG`      | 100    | Detailed information for debugging (e.g., variable contents, small flows). Usually only used during development. |
| **info**     | `Logger::INFO`       | 200    | General events, normal status (user login, job ran successfully).           |
| **notice**   | `Logger::NOTICE`     | 250    | Important events but not errors (e.g., service started, cache rebuilt).     |
| **warning**  | `Logger::WARNING`    | 300    | Potential issues (e.g., disk almost full, slow query).                      |
| **error**    | `Logger::ERROR`      | 400    | Errors that need attention (exceptions, failed to send email).              |
| **critical** | `Logger::CRITICAL`   | 500    | Serious conditions, partial system failure (database down).                 |
| **alert**    | `Logger::ALERT`      | 550    | Must be handled immediately, critical system not running (payment service down). |
| **emergency**| `Logger::EMERGENCY`  | 600    | System is completely unusable (total down).                                 |

## How It Works

If the channel in the config uses:

```php
'level' => 'error',
```

Then logs with level **error**, **critical**, **alert**, and **emergency** will be recorded.  
But **debug**, **info**, **notice**, and **warning** will not be included.

If level = `debug`, all logs will be included.

---

### Usage Example

```php
Log::debug('Test debug');
Log::info('User login');
Log::warning('Low disk space');
Log::error('DB down');
```

The result depends on the channel level.

---

## Channel Stack

If using a channel stack:

```php
'stack' => [
    'driver' => 'stack',
    'channels' => ['daily', 'custom-database'],
    'ignore_exceptions' => false,
],
```

Every time you call:

```php
Log::error('Something went wrong');
```

Laravel will try to write the log to all channels in the array (`daily` and `custom-database`).

---

### Case: logs table (custom-database) does not exist

- **Channel daily** → successfully writes to `storage/logs/laravel-YYYY-MM-DD.log` ✅
- **Channel custom-database** → when `LoggingHandler` tries to insert into the logs table, it will get an exception "Base table or view not found" ❌

Because in the config `ignore_exceptions = false`, the exception will be passed to the application.  
👉 As a result, the application can error/crash just because the log failed to be written to the DB.

---

### If `ignore_exceptions = true`

```php
'stack' => [
    'driver' => 'stack',
    'channels' => ['daily', 'custom-database'],
    'ignore_exceptions' => true,
],
```

- Laravel will ignore errors from one of the channels.
- Logs will still go into daily (file).
- Failed DB inserts will be ignored.
- The application will keep running without crashing 🚀

---

## Conclusion

- `ignore_exceptions = false` (default) → stricter, but can cause app errors if a channel is broken.
- `ignore_exceptions = true` → safer in production, because failed log channels do not interfere with the application's operation.
